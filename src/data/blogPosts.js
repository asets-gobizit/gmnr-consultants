    title: 'Why Renewable Energy Projects Still Need Old-School Business Developers',
    excerpt: 'The green energy sector is booming with innovation — but closing deals still requires human relationships, trust, and negotiation skills that no algorithm can replace.',

    content: [
      { type: 'p', text: "There's a popular narrative in the renewable energy sector: technology will solve everything. Better solar panels, smarter grids, more efficient turbines — and the deals will follow. But after years of working at the intersection of clean energy and international business development, I can tell you that narrative misses a critical piece." },
      { type: 'p', text: "The technology is extraordinary. What gets projects stuck isn't engineering — it's the human side. It's the partnership that fell apart because nobody managed expectations. It's the market entry that stalled because the company didn't understand local procurement norms. It's the joint venture that never closed because both sides were negotiating from assumptions instead of shared understanding." },
      { type: 'h2', text: 'Relationships Are Still the Currency' },
      { type: 'p', text: "In mature markets like Germany or the Netherlands, the renewable energy supply chain is well-established but fiercely competitive. Breaking in as a foreign company requires more than a good product — it requires trust. And trust is built face-to-face, over time, through people who understand both sides of the table." },
      { type: 'p', text: "In emerging markets — parts of Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America — the dynamics are different but the principle is the same. Local partners are essential, and finding the right one (not just any one) requires judgment, due diligence, and cultural fluency that no CRM system can provide." },
      { type: 'h2', text: 'The Gap Between Innovation and Revenue' },
      { type: 'p', text: "I've seen brilliant clean-tech companies with patented technology and strong pilot results struggle to generate revenue. Not because their product was wrong, but because they approached business development as an afterthought. They assumed that a superior product would sell itself." },
      { type: 'p', text: "It doesn't. Especially not in energy, where sales cycles are measured in months or years, procurement decisions involve multiple stakeholders across technical, financial, and political functions, regulatory landscapes vary enormously by country, and reference projects carry more weight than spec sheets." },
      { type: 'h2', text: 'What Effective Business Development Looks Like in Renewables' },
      { type: 'p', text: "It starts with strategy, not activity. Before making calls or booking flights, you need to answer hard questions: Which markets offer the best fit for your technology and your capacity? Who are the real decision-makers? What's the competitive landscape, and where are the gaps?" },
      { type: 'p', text: "Then it's execution — systematic, patient, and persistent. Mapping the ecosystem, building relationships, securing introductions, structuring proposals that align with how the buyer actually makes decisions. And following through, consistently, even when the deal isn't moving as fast as you'd like." },
      { type: 'h2', text: 'The Opportunity Is Enormous — But Not Automatic' },
      { type: 'p', text: "Global investment in clean energy continues to break records. Governments are legislating transition timelines. Corporations are under pressure to decarbonize. The demand is real and growing." },
      { type: 'p', text: "But demand alone doesn't close deals. Somebody has to do the work of connecting the right solutions with the right buyers, in the right markets, on terms that make sense for both sides. That's business development. And in an industry this complex, this regulated, and this relationship-driven, it's anything but old-school — it's essential." },

    excerpt: "After helping dozens of companies enter new markets, I keep seeing the same avoidable errors. Here's what to watch for.",
    featured: false,
    content: [
      { type: 'p', text: "International expansion is one of the most powerful growth levers available to a company. It's also one of the most misunderstood. Over the years, I've helped companies enter markets across Europe, Asia, and the Americas — and I keep seeing the same mistakes, often made by smart teams that simply underestimate the complexity of going global." },
      { type: 'h2', text: '1. Treating International as a Copy-Paste of Domestic' },
      { type: 'p', text: "What works in your home market — your messaging, your pricing, your sales process — was shaped by that market. It reflects local norms, local competition, and local buyer behavior. Transplanting it unchanged into a new geography almost never works." },
      { type: 'p', text: "This doesn't mean you need to reinvent everything. But you do need to invest time understanding what's different. Sometimes the adjustments are small — pricing structure, payment terms. Sometimes they're fundamental — the entire go-to-market channel needs to change. The point is: you won't know until you look." },
      { type: 'h2', text: '2. Entering Too Many Markets at Once' },
      { type: 'p', text: "Ambition is great. But spreading your resources across five new countries simultaneously is a recipe for five mediocre outcomes. International expansion requires focus — deep engagement with a specific market, building real relationships, and developing local credibility." },
      { type: 'quote', text: "Pick one or two markets where you have the strongest strategic fit. Win there first. Then expand from a position of strength, with reference customers and proven playbooks." },
      { type: 'h2', text: '3. Hiring Locally Before Understanding the Market' },
      { type: 'p', text: "The instinct to \"get boots on the ground\" is understandable. But hiring a local sales rep or country manager before you've validated the market opportunity, defined your positioning, and identified target accounts is putting the cart before the horse." },
      { type: 'p', text: "A better approach: start with a senior business development engagement — someone who can map the landscape, test the value proposition, and build initial relationships. Once you have real pipeline and market validation, then invest in a permanent local presence." },
      { type: 'h2', text: '4. Underestimating the Regulatory Landscape' },
      { type: 'p', text: "Every country has its own regulatory environment, and in sectors like energy, clean-tech, and infrastructure, those regulations can make or break your market entry. Certification requirements, procurement rules, local content mandates, data privacy laws — these aren't afterthoughts, they're gatekeepers." },
      { type: 'p', text: "I've seen companies invest months in relationship-building and proposal development only to discover that their product requires a certification they don't have, or that local procurement rules effectively require a local partner they haven't identified. Do the regulatory homework early. It saves enormous time and credibility." },
      { type: 'h2', text: '5. Giving Up Too Soon' },
      { type: 'p', text: "International business development is slower than domestic. Relationships take longer to build. Decision cycles are longer. The feedback loop is less immediate. Companies accustomed to quick domestic wins can lose patience." },
      { type: 'p', text: "The truth is, most international markets don't yield results in the first quarter — or even the second. But when they do start producing, the returns compound. A strong position in a new market becomes a durable competitive advantage that's hard for others to replicate." },
      { type: 'p', text: "The companies that succeed internationally are the ones that commit to the process, invest in the right support, and maintain strategic patience. That combination is far more effective than any shortcut." },
